While other royals studied etiquette and embroidery, she spent her days in the palace workshop, learning the secret languages that commanded the tiny machines - the mites and assemblers that built their world.

One day, a great mechanical dragon appeared at the kingdom's borders, its scales gleaming like polished steel, steam rising from its nostrils. The people were afraid, but Princess ${readerName ? readerName : 'Aria'} noticed something curious...

The dragon's movements followed a pattern, like a complex dance or perhaps... a code.`,

Three steps forward, two to the left, pause, then a graceful turn... She began to see it wasn't random at all. It was binary! The dragon was trying to communicate.

"01001000 01100101 01101100 01110000" - step by step, the dragon spelled out its message in the ancient language of machines.

"Help," ${readerName ? readerName : 'Aria'} whispered, understanding flooding through her. This was no monster - this was someone trapped inside a mechanical shell, crying out to be freed.

But how does one free someone from such a prison?`,
