Second, the FUNCTION - the purpose it serves, the problems it solves. But what function does a dragon serve? Perhaps it is not what it does, but what it preserves that matters.

Third, and most mysterious, the FLOW - the animating force that gives it life. In crude machines, this is mere electricity or steam. But in the dragon, the flow is something more... it is consciousness itself, encoded in quantum states, existing in the spaces between the gears.
