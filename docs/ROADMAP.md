# Young Lady's Primer - Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Foundation ✅
*Building the essential framework for an interactive educational primer*

### Story System
- [x] Basic branching narrative structure
- [x] Choice-driven progression with navigation
- [x] Personalized content using reader's name
- [x] Story progress tracking with localStorage
- [x] Back navigation and history
- [ ] Reduce choice overload (fewer options per page for containment)
- [ ] Story convergence points and multiple endings

### User Experience
- [x] Victorian manuscript-style UI design
- [x] Settings system with name customization
- [x] First-run experience with optional name entry
- [x] Dark mode with Victorian "candlelit manuscript" aesthetic
- [x] Reading progress tracking in settings
- [x] Visual-first UI principle (icon → label → action pattern)
- [ ] Responsive design and elegant animations (partially complete)
- [ ] Table of contents that fills out as reader progresses
- [ ] 3D navigation map visualization (inspired by Treasure Planet)

### Design System
- [x] Visual-First Cognition design principle documented
- [x] Comprehensive design documentation (DESIGN.md)
- [x] Color palette for light and dark modes
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (WCAG AA compliance)
- [ ] Animation system refinement

### Deployment & Access
- [x] Deploy to GitHub Pages for free public access
- [x] Configure Next.js static export for GitHub Pages
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing on real devices
- [ ] Consider Vercel/Netlify migration for custom domain & performance
- [ ] Custom domain setup (youngladysprimer.com?)

### Content Management
- [x] Modular content organization by theme
- [x] TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- [x] Dragon story arc with multiple approach paths
- [ ] Complete dragon story with resolution branches
- [ ] Lesson integration within stories
- [ ] Puzzle integration within stories

## Phase 2: Content Expansion
*Creating rich educational content across multiple domains*

### Story Arcs
- [ ] Extended dragon story with deeper transformation branches
- [ ] Additional story arcs beyond dragon narrative
- [ ] Multiple ending paths that converge meaningfully
- [ ] Character development and emotional depth

### Educational Content
- [ ] Nanotechnology lessons (expanded)
- [ ] Mathematics concepts woven into narratives
- [ ] Art and science integration
- [ ] History lessons (Ada Lovelace inspiration)
- [ ] Language and communication fundamentals
- [ ] Music theory and wave concepts
- [ ] Introduction to computational thinking
- [ ] Economics: trade, resource flow, and human desire

### Interactive Elements
- [ ] Molecular lock puzzle system (enhanced)
- [ ] Logic puzzles integrated into story
- [ ] Pattern recognition challenges
- [ ] Creative problem-solving scenarios

## Phase 3: Adaptive Learning
*Making the primer responsive to individual readers*

### Intelligence System
- [ ] Reader choice analysis for level estimation
- [ ] Adaptive content difficulty based on responses
- [ ] Multiple intelligence tracking (spatial, logical, etc.)
- [ ] Progress-based content unlocking
- [ ] Subtle challenge progression without age prompts

### Age-Appropriate Scaling
- [ ] Content variants for 5-8, 9-12, 13-16 age ranges
- [ ] Neo-Victorian language complexity for advanced levels
- [ ] UI complexity adaptation based on reader level
- [ ] Vocabulary and concept sophistication scaling

### Personalization
- [ ] Reader co-creation of story elements
- [ ] Choice-influenced narrative shaping
- [ ] Personal learning path tracking
- [ ] Individual strength/interest identification

## Phase 4: Enhanced Experience
*Polish and advanced features for deeper engagement*

### Technical Enhancements
- [ ] Save/load functionality for longer reading sessions
- [ ] Audio narration system (AI-generated)
- [ ] Text-to-speech integration
- [ ] Voice interaction capabilities
- [ ] Offline-first design for device independence

### Social Features
- [ ] Progress sharing capabilities (privacy-focused)
- [ ] Collaborative learning elements
- [ ] Peer connection system for young women
- [ ] Federated learning network exploration

## Phase 5: Physical Device
*Transition from software prototype to dedicated hardware*

### reMarkable Prototype
- [ ] Fork project for reMarkable Paper Pro
- [ ] Adapt UI for e-paper display constraints
- [ ] Touch-only interaction design
- [ ] Linux/Codex OS adaptation
- [ ] Stylus-free interface optimization

### Custom Hardware Vision
- [ ] Research e-paper display technologies (Modos, etc.)
- [ ] Design waterproof device specifications
- [ ] Evaluate foldable screen options
- [ ] Power management for outdoor reading
- [ ] Audio system integration (speaker/mic)
- [ ] Internet connectivity strategy (minimal, privacy-focused)

## Phase 6: AI Integration
*Dynamic content generation and advanced adaptation*

### Content Generation
- [ ] Static story framework for AI training
- [ ] Dynamic narrative generation system
- [ ] Real-time content adaptation
- [ ] Quality control for generated content

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Local AI model deployment strategy
- [ ] Cloud vs. device computation decisions
- [ ] Privacy-preserving learning systems
- [ ] Federated learning implementation
- [ ] P2P network considerations
