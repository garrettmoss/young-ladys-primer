## About

This project is inspired by Neal Stephenson's *The Diamond Age*, where the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer serves as an adaptive educational tool that provides personalized learning experiences. In Stephenson's novel, the Primer is a nanotechnology-enhanced book that grows with its reader, offering tailored stories, moral lessons, and intellectual challenges that evolve based on the child's development and circumstances.

Our implementation aims to capture that vision of adaptive, personalized education through modern technology - creating an interactive learning experience that responds to each reader's unique needs, interests, and learning pace.

## Features (coming soon)

- **Adaptive Content**: Stories and lessons that evolve based on reader interaction and progress
- **Personalized Learning**: Customized challenges and educational paths for individual users
- **Interactive Storytelling**: Engaging narratives that respond to reader choices and development
- **Progressive Complexity**: Content sophistication that grows alongside the reader's abilities

## Vision

Just as Stephenson envisioned a book that could serve as both entertainment and education, adapting to guide its reader through life's complexities, this project explores how we might create similar adaptive learning experiences using contemporary tools and technologies.
